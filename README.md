Ludum Dare 49 entry.

All code/assets were created by me during the weekend. My primary focus in this jam was to work solo and try to create my own sprites. Sprite creation took longer than anticipated, so I didn't have time to do any audio work.

Special thanks to finsternacht for keeping me company during drawing process.

## How to Play
To control power output of the power plant, <b>click & drag</b> the fuel rods.

To prevent the water intake from clogging and overheating the reactor, <b>click</b> on the debris in the water.

To safely dispose radioactive waste, <b>click & drag</b> it into the barrel.

Camera controls:
"1" - Reactor camera
"2" - Waterway camera
"3" - Waste camera

Producing too little or too much power, overheating the reactor, or accumulating too much of radioactive waste loses the game.
